This is LyZ, patched to work better with Zotero (and the [[http://github.com/unhammer/zotero-natbib][zotero-natbib]]
translator) and the Zotero-patched [[http://github.com/unhammer/writer2latex][Writer2LaTeX]].

After checking out, do 

#+BEGIN_SRC
zip -r lyz.xpi ./*
#+END_SRC

to create the plugin. Open the file in Firefox to install, the restart. Now you can enter LyZ settings from Zotero, and enter the citekey format "writer2latex". You'll probably also want to select "BibTeX (natbib)" as the export style, if you installed [[http://github.com/unhammer/zotero-natbib][zotero-natbib]]. 

See http://www.klubko.net/wp/?page_id=945&lang=en for the original LyZ
extension.
